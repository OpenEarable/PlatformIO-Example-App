### Default Firmware
The easiest way to compile and deploy the OpenEarable firmware is this App sketch for [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org). 
Before you start, please make sure you have setup [PlatformIO for VSCode](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode).


You can then open this project to compile and deploy the OpenEarable firmware. It will be controllable via our [Dashboard](https://github.com/OpenEarable/dashboard), via [edge-ml](https://edge-ml.org/), and the BLE API.
